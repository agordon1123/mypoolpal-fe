## TECH
This front-end is built using React. This application will allow users to create an account, log in, add pools to their account, record chemistry readings for a pool, and receive suggested adjustments to be made to correct water chemistry. 

Future releases will include a troubleshooting tree to help pool owners diagnose common issues with their pool without having to contact a service company, helping customers save money. We would also like to link recommendations to local pool companies if the troubleshooting tree determines a repair is needed.
